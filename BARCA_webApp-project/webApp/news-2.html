			<h2>Rise of the golden boy</h2>
			<p class="description">Domastic succes wasn't even questionable after few games for Leo Messi.</p>
			<p>During the 2003–04 season, his fourth with Barcelona, Messi rapidly progressed through the club's ranks, debuting for a record five teams in a single campaign. 
			<p>After being named player of the tournament in four international pre-season competitions with the Juveniles B,
				 he played only one official match with the team before being promoted to the Juveniles A, where he scored 18 goals in 11 league games.</p>
			<p>On 24 June 2005, his 18th birthday, Messi signed his first contract as a senior team player. It made him a Barcelona player until 2010,
				 two years less than his previous contract, but his buyout clause increased to €150 million.</p>
			<p>In his first uninterrupted campaign, the 2008–09 season, he scored 38 goals in 51 games,
				 contributing alongside Eto'o and winger Thierry Henry to a total of 100 goals in all competitions, 
				 a record at the time for the club.</p>
			<p>During his first season under Barcelona's new manager, former captain Pep Guardiola, Messi played mainly on the right wing, like he had under Rijkaard,
				 though this time as a false winger with the freedom to cut inside and roam the centre</p>
			<p>With 23 league goals from Messi that season, Barcelona became La Liga champions three days later and achieved its fifth double.</p>
			<p>At 22 years old, Messi won the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, both times by the greatest voting margin in each trophy's history.</p>
			<p>As the league's top scorer with 34 goals (again tying Ronaldo's record), he helped Barcelona win a second consecutive La Liga trophy with only a single defeat.</p>
			<p>2012: A record-breaking year he surpassed César Rodríguez's record of 190 league goals,
				 becoming Barcelona's all-time top scorer in La Liga, and Gerd Müller's record of most goals scored in a calendar year, 
				 overtaking his 85 goals scored in 1972 for Bayern Munich and Germany.</p>
			<p>2014–15: A historic treble - A hat-trick scored against Sevilla on 22 November made him the all-time top scorer in La Liga,
				 as he surpassed the 59-year record of 251 league goals held by Telmo Zarra.</p>
			<p>2015–16: Domestic success - Messi won the FIFA Ballon d'Or for a record fifth time in his career.n total, Messi scored 41 goals and provided 23 assists, 
				as Barcelona's attacking trio managed a Spanish record of 131 goals throughout the season, breaking the record they had set the previous season</p>
			<p>2016–17: Fourth Golden Boot - Messi finished the 2016–17 season with 54 goals and 16 assists, while his 37 goals in 
				La Liga saw him claim both the Pichichi and European Golden Boot Awards for the fourth time in his career.</p>
			<p>2017–18: Domestic double and a record fifth Golden Boot - On 18 October, in his 122nd European club appearance, Messi scored his 97th UEFA Champions League goal,4
				 and his 100th in all UEFA club competitions. On 4 March, he scored his 600th senior career goal from a free kick in a 1–0 home win over Atlético Madrid, 
				 in La Liga.</p>
