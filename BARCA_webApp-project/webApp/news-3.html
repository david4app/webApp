			<h2><strong>Pep Guardiola - Managerial career</strong></h2>
			<p class="description">Guardiola was first appointed as coach of Barcelona B on 21 June 2007, then in May 2008 Guardiola was appointed manager of the senior Barcelona squad.</p>
			<p>Guardiola's first competitive game as coach was in the third qualifying round of the Champions League, in which Barça comfortably beat Polish club Wisła Kraków 4–0 in the first leg at home. 
			   They then lost 1–0 in the second leg, but progressed with a 4–1 aggregate victory.</p>
			<p>The most important match, however, was on 2 May when they defeated Real Madrid 6–2 at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium. 
			   Earlier on 13 May 2009, Barcelona won the Copa del Rey, defeating Athletic Bilbao by 4–1.</p>
			<p>The league title was the second piece of silverware in Guardiola's first season at the Camp Nou.</p>
			<p> In the final of the Champions League, Barcelona beat Manchester United 2–0. In doing so, they became the first Spanish club to win the domestic cup, the league, and the European club titles 
				(the treble) in the same season. The treble-winning season is regarded as one of the club's finest in its history.
				 Furthermore, he became the youngest man to coach a Champions League winning team.</p>
			<p>During Guardiola's second season as manager, Barcelona gave Guardiola his 50th professional victory, away against Málaga and on 19 December, 
				they were crowned FIFA Club World Cup champions for the first time in their history.</p>
			<p>Guardiola finished the calendar year 2009 with a record six trophies, the Spanish League, Copa del Rey, Champions League, Spanish Super Cup, European Super Cup and Club World Cup,
				 becoming the first manager in history to do so</p>
			<p>On February 2010, Guardiola coached his 100th match for Barcelona's first team. His record stood at 71 wins, 19 draws and 10 losses with 242 goals for and 76 against</p>
			<p>At the end of 2011-12 season he was stepped down as Barca coach. His record of 14 trophies in four seasons has made him the most successful coach in Barcelona's history.</p>
